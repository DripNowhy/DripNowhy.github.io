    Hi there! I'm an incoming PhD student at <strong>Purdue University</strong> <img src="images/purdue.svg" alt="Purdue Logo" style="height:1em; vertical-align:middle;">, Department of Computer Science, advised by <strong><a href="https://ruqizhang.github.io/" style="color: DarkSlateBlue;">Dr. Ruqi Zhang</a></strong>. I am also in my final year as an undergraduate student at the <strong>School of Mathematics, Tianjin University</strong> <img src="images/tju.png" alt="TJU Logo" style="height:1em; vertical-align:middle;">. Previously, I worked as a research assistant in the MLDM Lab's <strong>Multimodal Vision Processing (MVP)</strong> Group, under the guidance of <strong><a href="https://bcaosudo.github.io/" style="color: DarkSlateBlue;">Dr. Bing Cao</a></strong>.  

    My research interests lie in developing reliable machine learning algorithms and frameworks for real-world applications, with a particular focus on the alignment of Large Foundation Models (LLMs and VLMs) and the generalization of multimodal learning algorithms.
